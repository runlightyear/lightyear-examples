# Lightyear Examples

There are so many things you can do with the Lightyear platform that we couldn't possible think of all of them ourselves. So we have established this example repository for the community to share what they have done with each other.

Each directory is a Lightyear project that you can deploy to your dev environment. In general, you'll need to change to the directory and install the packages.

```shell
cd <example>
npm install
```

Then get your Lightyear credentials

```shell
npx lightyear login
```

Most of the examples will have instance-specific constants that you will need to set before running.

When ready, run the dev server

```shell
npm run dev
```

Have fun and let us know how these work for you!
